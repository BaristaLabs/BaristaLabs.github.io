                  Barista sprang out of 10+ years of SharePoint development experience developing native web applications on top of SharePoint.
                  We found that deploying and managing an ever-growing catalog of farm solutions, especially in strictly-controlled
                  farm environments, was a time consuming, error prone task. In 2012, the Barista Services Framework was
                  born and has been used by multiple clients in production saving hundreds-of-thousands of man-hours.</p>

                <p>We know that keeping your SharePoint farm pristine is of utmost importance. As such, Barista is built using
                  only standard SharePoint development techniques. As a pure .NET based custom SharePoint service application,
                  Barista allows for advanced scaling and isolation scenarios that are native to SharePoint and enhanced
                  by Barista capabilities.</p>

                  Stop writing boilerplate service initialization configuation and code. Barista lets you eliminate the micro-service standup
                  and focus on writing the business logic for your service using serverless-style methodology. As Barista code executes on
                  the server via a custom runtime, providing for a generic and uniform execution environment for your micro-services. All these
                  capabilites add up to provide you a productive system to write your SharePoint micro-services.

                <p>If the built-in modules are not enough, Barista allows custom modules to be developed and exposed to the
                  services framework. Existing .NET based business logic can be wrapped and exposed easily and exposed to specific locations
                  within your SharePoint environment. JavaScript-based libraries can also be exposed and utilized.</p>
